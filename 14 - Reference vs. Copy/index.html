      let age = 100;
      let age2 = age;
      console.log(age, age2);
      // we get 100, 100

      age = 200;
      console.log(age, age2);
      // we get 200, 100.. this is because we have only updated the age variable, not age2. doesn't update the other one.

      let name = "Paul";
      let name2 = name;
      console.log(name, name2);
      // will get Paul, Paul

      name = "Wes";
      console.log(name, name2);
      // will get Wes, Paul
      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;

      console.log(players, team);
      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = "Lux";
      // players will actually update to lux. We updated team and it referenced the initial players array. It's actually not even an array, simply a reference
      console.log(players, team);
      // now here is the problem!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      // if we pass nothing into slice, it can make a copy of the original array
      const team2 = players.slice();
      team2[3] = "Mike";
      console.log(team2, team, players);

      // another way using concat
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the ES6 spread operator
      const team4 = [...players];

      // could use .from ...
      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      captain.name = "Mike";
      // will actually have person as a value for the name key/property of person
      console.log(person, captain);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      // we can use Object.assign.
      // it takes the empty object as the first argument, what you want to copy as the second, and what to fold in as the third, fourth, etc.
      const captain2 = Object.assign(
        {},
        person,
        { number: 99 },
        { name: "Paul" }
      );

      console.log(person, captain, captain2);
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      // only one level deep, meaning if we wanted to use Object.Assign to create a new object that had an object...
      // if we were to go into that second object and make a change, it would actually update the first object.

      //cloneDeep is an option, or you can...
      const dev = Object.assign({}, person);
      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
